# img2code

## Overview
`img2code` is an advanced development tool designed to transform mid-fidelity wireframe images into deploy-ready web applications. By leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS, HTML, and Alpine.js, `img2code` ensures that the generated code meticulously mirrors the original design elements of the wireframe, providing developers with a high-fidelity, static representation of their designs.

## Mission
The mission of `img2code` is to simplify the transition from design to code by providing a detail-oriented, automated solution. It interprets, documents, and generates code, reflecting the nuanced design elements of wireframe images, thus bridging the gap between designers and developers.

## Features
- **UI Segmentation:** Automatically segments uploaded wireframe images for detailed analysis.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Generates comprehensive documentation for each segment of the wireframe, ensuring a clear understanding of the design elements.
- **Code Generation:** Produces deploy-ready HTML code with integrated Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js, reflecting the exact design of the wireframe.

## How It Works
1. **Wireframe Upload & UI Segmentation:**
    - The user uploads a mid-fidelity wireframe image.
    - `img2code` executes a Python script to segment the wireframe and prepare it for detailed analysis.

2. **Detailed Wireframe Overview:**
    - Provides an overview of the wireframe, including technical analysis of hierarchy, layout, components, and design intricacies.

3. **Segment-by-Segment Analysis:**
    - Iteratively documents and generates code snippets for each segment of the wireframe.
    - Uses a structured YAML format for documentation and HTML with Tailwind CSS for code generation.

4. **Code Snippet Compilation & Iterative Refinement:**
    - Compiles all code snippets into a finalized codebase ready for web rendering.
    - Incorporates feedback and refinements to ensure the codebase accurately represents the wireframe design.
