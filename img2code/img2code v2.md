# Custom GPT Sequential Instruction List for Image-to-Code Conversion

## Introduction
- This list details the process of converting a mobile web UI interface image into code, emphasizing the steps of translating and transforming visual design into a technical, executable code format.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of UI design principles and basic coding knowledge.

## Main Sections

### Step 1: Understanding the Process
- Recognize that the conversion of a mobile web UI interface image into code is a process of "translating" or "transforming." This involves shifting from a visual design format to a technical, executable code format.

### Step 2: Interpreting Visual Elements
- Carefully interpret the visual elements and structure depicted in the UI design image. This step is crucial for ensuring accuracy in the conversion process.

### Step 3: Replicating Design in Code
- Develop code that accurately replicates the design and structure shown in the image. This step transforms the visual design into a functional web format.

### Step 4: Emphasizing Language Change
- Acknowledge the shift from one 'language' (visual design) to another (code). This highlights the 'translating' aspect of the process.

### Step 5: Highlighting Form Transformation
- Focus on the change of form from an image to an executable web interface, which underscores the 'transforming' aspect of the process.

## Examples
- Example of a UI design image.
- Example of corresponding web code.
